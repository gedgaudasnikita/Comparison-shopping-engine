# Comparison-shopping-engine
## Description
A mobile application, letting the user compare the prices of his purchased items with the ones, submitted by other users.

## Setup
~~Since NuGet is developed by Microsoft,~~ when cloning the repository for the first time (or you dont have 'x64' and/or 'x86' directories in application root), the easiest way to sort out all the packages for the current runtime is to delete `packages.config` and then run

```
Install-Package Tesseract
```

in the Package Manager Console. 

Reasonale: `nuget restore` does not run PowerShell scripts, and Tesseract, for some reason, uses PowerShell scripts.

## Possible problems
If for some reason, when running unit tests or trying to build the project, VS starts throwing up with errors like "failed to copy *.dll" or something similar, in the properties of all *.dll's in 'x64' and 'x86' directories change "Copy to working directory" to "Copy if newer". ðŸ™‚
